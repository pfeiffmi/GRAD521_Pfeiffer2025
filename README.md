## Research Context

The ocean is a vast and dangerous environment that is known to be largely unexplored. While there exist mapping tools for the ocean floor (e.g., sonar), these technologies don’t allow physical interaction with the environment. If one then wishes to gather physical samples or gather debris from the ocean floor, a human diver would need to dive at extreme depths to complete the task. 

However, if we wish to avoid putting a human life in danger, an alternative method would be to control a robot so the human can perform the task from a relatively safer place. Unfortunately, controlling an underwater robot is easier said than done since low-lighting conditions, murky waters, and aggressive underwater currents make it hard to interpret sensor information. This brings up a question regarding what sensory information to gather from the robot and how the information can best be displayed to the commander.

Since the low-lighting and murky water both impair visual clarity, one possibly helpful piece of sensory information would be tactile sensors, which allow the human to gain a sense of what the robot is touching. This brings us to our main research question, which is as follows: How do different display types of tactile information interact with different grasps on objects to impact a human’s ability to correctly identify the success of a grasp? An example of what we are looking for with this question is whether a display would be better for detecting if an object is slipping from the robot’s grasp while another would be better at identifying when an object is securely grasped).

In order to answer this question, we will be showing human subjects pre-recorded grasps with different tactile displays and a camera feed that is artificially impaired by adding a significant blur to it. The impaired camera feed is done so that users will have to rely on the tactile information to make their decision about the success of a grasp.
