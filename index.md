# Data Description

## Human Subjects Data

The first dataset will consist of all relevant human subject data. This includes demographic information (age, sex, race, home country), general attitudes towards robots, familiarity with robots, per-trial information (accuracy, confidence, reaction-time), and the overall task information (subjective task-load rating). All data will be stored in a spreadsheet alongside a corresponding subject ID and task version ID to match the subject and display to the data obtained. The data will be collected and saved to a spreadsheet as the user interacts with the computer software by manually entering the information or having it collected automatically throughout the experiment.

### Dataset Size

The human subjects dataset is expected to be on the order of MB (100-999 MB) since we anticipate testing around 40 participants on about 60 trials alongside responses to questionnaires.

## Metadata

The second dataset will consist of data for conducting the test (and available for replication of the study). This will be the metadata, which includes the code for displaying the interface, the recordings of the camera feed (as video files) and tactile feed (as spreadsheets) for each grasp, and the code for all analyses performed in the study. This data will be collected prior to the study by storing recorded sensory feeds from a robotic arm that is currently in the lab.

### Dataset Size

The metadata dataset will be larger than the human subjects data due to the use of video files alongside code. This dataset is expected to be on the order of a few GB (1-9 GB) since there will be around 40-50 video files that are around 30 seconds each.
